# mleBIC

This is a collection of MATLAB scripts to employ mleBIC analysis. The main code is contained within the main.m file.  

### MLE (directory)

Contains functions for the likelihood functions for various diffusion models, including normal diffusion, driven diffusion, confined diffusion, and fractional Brownian motion.

### Model Selection (directory)

Contains functions to perform Bayesian information criterion model selection and empirical Bayes model selection.

### Numerical (directory)

Contains helper functions to calculate the likelihood functions in a way to avoid numerical underflow/overflow.
